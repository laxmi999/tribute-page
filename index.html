          <p class="details longtext">
            Lee Hyunsung is a straightforward and earnest man. He cares deeply
            for people, wanting to support and protect others as best as he can.
            He is extremely loyal, willing to tolerate pain and/or injury to
            help those he cares for, although unwilling to self-sacrifice
            altogether or see others sacrifice themselves. He is more of a
            follower than a leader and prefers structure. This personality trait
            is apparent in how he lived his life by the soldiers' manual, as
            well as how he follows and trusts in the plans of leaders like Kim
            Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk. Even so, Lee Hyunsung is a man of
            contradictions: while he lives his life by a manual, he also hates
            the manual he is bound to more than anyone else.

            enjoys joking around and being casual, being very emotionally
            expressive. She is a bit of a romantic. Due to the scenarios,
            however, she becomes more grim and serious at times. She can be
            somewhat reckless and prioritizes others' health and happiness over
            her own, as seen in early scenarios when she goes to protect
            complete strangers. She is dutiful and strongly respects her
            seniors, particularly Yoo Joonghyuk (who she calls Master) and Jung
            Heewon, idolizing them and longing for recognition from them. In
            particular, she looks up to Yoo Joonghyuk's determination and
            ability to power through desperate situations.

          <p class="details longtext">
            Lee Gilyoung appears rather brash and combative, often being rude or
            blunt in speech. He is proud, with an easily bruised ego, and he is
            somewhat insecure. He is brave and a good judge of actions and
            personality, being able to discern Kim Dokja's motives more than
            once. He is deeply loyal and possessive over those people and things
            he deems "his".
