            for people, wanting to support and protect others as best as he can.
            He is extremely loyal, willing to tolerate pain and/or injury to
            help those he cares for, although unwilling to self-sacrifice
            altogether or see others sacrifice themselves. He is more of a
            follower than a leader and prefers structure. This personality trait
            is apparent in how he lived his life by the soldiers' manual, as
            well as how he follows and trusts in the plans of leaders like Kim

            her own, as seen in early scenarios when she goes to protect
            complete strangers. She is dutiful and strongly respects her
            seniors, particularly Yoo Joonghyuk (who she calls Master) and Jung
            Heewon, idolizing them and longing for recognition from them. In
